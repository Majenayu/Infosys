# User Service Deployment Fix

## Issue Resolved
The user dashboard was showing Internal Server Error due to template routing issues.

## Problem
Template was referencing non-existent Flask routes:
- `url_for('qr_generator')` - route doesn't exist in user_app.py 
- `url_for('qr_scanner')` - route doesn't exist in user_app.py

## Solution
Updated navigation links in `templates/user_dashboard.html` to:
- Link to company QR generator: `https://tracksmart-company.onrender.com/qr`
- Link to delivery portal: `https://tracksmart-delivery.onrender.com/`

## Status
✅ Template errors fixed
✅ User dashboard now loads successfully  
✅ Ready for Render deployment update

## Next Steps
1. Deploy updated code to Render
2. Test user registration → dashboard flow
3. Verify cross-service navigation works correctly
